# About Me

Hey, I'm Tim!

I started my journey in computer science and security at 15 when I found a vulnerability in the Windows Active Directory setup at my school. This discovery led me to start a cybersecurity club with the Head of Technology. Since then, I've taken on various roles in both software development and cybersecurity.

With a degree in Computer Science and Japanese Language from the University of Maryland, College Park, I moved to Japan to teach English, hoping to make personal connections and immerse myself in the culture. While teaching has been rewarding, it has confirmed that my true passion lies in technology. I'm now excited to return to the field of computer science.

My background in software development and cybersecurity has sharpened my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and technical knowledge. I'm confident in my ability to thrive in dynamic environments and contribute to both areas. Please feel free to browse this website and my projects or connect with me on LinkedIn!
